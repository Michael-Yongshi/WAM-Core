# Warhammer Army Manager (WAM)

An application in order to create, update, view and save your warband details for use in the Mordheim Warhammer world. Using this application there is no need anymore for manually calculating skills or looking up your warbands details, including references to all item, spells, abilities, etc. that are ingame and the rules governing engagements.

No libraries are used actively

## Roadmap
- Adding calculation tables for use in battles, like hit tables, wound tables and injury tables
- Adding your own warband rules, items, abilities, etc. for use in more custom made games.
- Adding decorative events to warbands, characters and items, to individualize and decorate the achievements or special happening, including who you fought, who killed that huge rat ogre, etc.
- Add Killteam rules and mechanics
