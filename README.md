# Warband_Manager

Todo:
Inventory and items
- Split inventory again in Treasury object and in an itemlist seperately, as only the warband itself can have gold and wyrd, it makes for more elegancy to split these, although should have no practical implications

Generate overviews of warband, herolists, squads, etc. easily.

Add events
- Characters decorative events
- Characters history events of changes
- Item decorative events

Unique names
- Item name change, although this is kind of already possible
- Henchman, similar to item name change



The Warband Manager


An application in order to create, update, view and save your warband details for use, including but not limited to, Mordheim and Killteam boardgames. Using this application there is no need anymore for manually calculating skills or looking up your warbands details, including references to all item, spells, abilities, etc. that are ingame.

In addition you can add your own warbands, items, rules, etc. for use in more custom made games.
