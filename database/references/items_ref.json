Handguns are not terribly reliable weapons: the gun barrel occasionally tends to explode violently or the powder fails to ignite. But the weapon has a great range and tremendous penetrating power, making a mockery of even the thickest armor. In Mordheim, handguns are rare and expensive, but a warband which can boast such a weapon will command respect from all its rivals."
