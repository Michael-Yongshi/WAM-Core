The crossbows of the Empire are made of steel and often include a winding mechanism to draw back the string. It takes a long time to prepare a crossbow, but a bolt fired from one has a tremendous range and can penetrate armor easily. Crossbows take much longer than other bows to make, so they are expensive and relatively rare weapons. Still, they are the preferred weapon of many in Mordheim because of their power and long range."

The quality of construction varies ranging from the crude wooden \u2018hakbuts\u2019 of the artillery school of Nuln, to the more sophisticated Dwarf firearms that have levers and springs which hold the burning match, and triggers which release the firing mechanism and fire the gun. Handguns are not terribly reliable weapons: the gun barrel occasionally tends to explode violently or the powder fails to ignite. But the weapon has a great range and tremendous penetrating power, making a mockery of even the thickest armor. In Mordheim, handguns are rare and expensive, but a warband which can boast such a weapon will command respect from all its rivals."
