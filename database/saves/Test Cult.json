    "description": "There is never any shortage of men willing to risk their lives for a chance of real power: men whose ambitions lie beyond the scope of their birthright, or whose sorcerous skills or physical deformities place them in constant danger of persecution. What do such men have to lose if they pledge their souls to the dark gods of Chaos!In the aftermath of the destruction of Mordheim all manner of mutants have appeared whilst many hitherto unblemished folk feel the stirring of strange powers, the first awakenings of magical gifts destined to bring them to a fiery death at the hands of the Witch Hunters. Now a leader has appeared, a new Dark Emperor, who claims lordship of the City of the Damned.He is called the Shadowlord, Master of the Possessed, and followers of the cults of Chaos gather from all over the Empire to pledge their souls to him. Though none know whether he is man or Daemon all proclaim him their saviour and eagerly seek to do his bidding. As all students of the dark arts know, it is by the power of magic that creatures such as Daemons and spirits are able to stalk the mortal world.The wyrdstone that proliferates in Mordheim grants unnatural life to many vile things that by all natural rights should never exist. The Possessed were once men but by surrendering themselves wholly to the dark gods they have allowed Daemons to possess their bodies. Their appearance is horrific \u2013 corrupted from within, their flesh is twisted into a new and monstrous form.With the power of the Possessed behind them the followers of the Shadowlord have grown powerful in Mordheim. In the Massacre of Silver Street the Cult of the Possessed ambushed and destroyed a large force sent in to hunt them down. Now the streets of Mordheim belong to the Shadowlord and his servants. The contaminated air does not affect them at all or, more likely, it nourishes their inner corruption.Men who venture into Mordheim alone are hunted down and sacrificed to the dark gods. All warbands of the Possessed gather wyrdstone for the Shadowlord who remains hidden in the Pit where he is said to be guarded by titanic Possessed the size of houses. A few shards of the precious stone are kept by the warbands and used to create more of the Possessed. Cult of the possessed.The leaders of cult warbands are called Magisters and each leads a group of cultists: minions of the dark gods of Chaos. These are men whose hunger for power knows no bounds, who willingly give their bodies over to possession. All take part in the blood sacrifices, dark rituals, and worship of Daemons \u2013 nothing is too base for them!These degenerate humans are joined by other creatures as vile as they \u2013 things half-man half-beast that call themselves Gors, and which men refer to as Beastmen. There are few sights as horrific as a cult warband. Deranged warriors smeared with blood and dirt wave jagged weapons and chant blasphemous rites as they throw themselves upon their foes.Many are hardly recognisable as human, their bodies are so scarred and disfigured. The stigmata of mutation is borne by most, but the most unsettling of all are the Possessed themselves \u2013 melded flesh made of men, beasts, and metal driven by the implacable will of a Daemon.<i>-The Possessed. The Damned. The bogeymen. These scum are the worst of the worst. They are dangerous creatures, perhaps more so than any other group in the entire city. This Chaos-worshipping scum consists of mutants, Beastmen and cultists, and even worse things called the Possessed. If you ever let them get close to you, you\u2019ll be in big trouble \u2013 there are few who are a match for this scum in close quarters.-</i>",
