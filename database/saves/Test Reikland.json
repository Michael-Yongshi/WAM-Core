    "description": "This is a time of unremitting war, civil strife, violence and famine. A time of orphan children and wanton slaughter. For warriors these are good times! Since the discovery of wyrdstone Mordheim has become a magnet for fighting men from all over the Empire. Nobles, merchants, and the Temple of Sigmar itself offer rich rewards for shards of the mysterious stone.Foremost amongst the patrons of mercenary warriors are the three most powerful contenders for the Emperor\u2019s throne: the Grand Prince of Reikland, the Count of Middenheim, and Lady Magritta of Marienburg \u2013 favourite of the merchant guilds. As a mercenary warband you must decide which of the three contenders for Sigmar\u2019s throne you are fighting for.Warbands from different places will vary in many respects, offering different benefits as well as having a unique appearance and character.Reikland lies at the heart of the Empire and its greatest city is Altdorf, home of the Grand Theogonist and seat of the Temple of Sigmar. Reiklanders are devout followers of Sigmar, the founder, first Emperor, and patron god of the Empire.The Grand Prince of Reikland (as Siegfried, the ruler of Reikland, styles himself) is supported in his claim to the throne by the Grand Theogonist and opposed most strongly by the Count of Middenheim and the Priests of Ulric.Throughout the Empire Reiklanders are commonly supposed to embody the discipline and loyalty of the professional warrior. Brave and well-versed in the arts of war, Reiklanders disdain fashionable clothing in favour of well-made and practical wargear.In battle they often wear coloured ribbons as marks of identification or authority. They are justly proud of their dynamic and ambitious Grand Prince and contemptuous of other claimants to the throne, especially the Count of Middenheim, Mannfred Todbringer, whom they sneeringly call the \u2018lap-dog of Ulric\u2019.<i>-Ah, Reiklanders, the finest of men! Disciplined, magnificent archers and good, solid warriors! Reiklanders need the best leaders, so you\u2019d better shape up boy! For these warriors are good at almost all the skills of war, and they are more likely to hold their nerve than others in Mordheim.-</i>",

Metal shields are heavy and cumbersome, but last much longer and can take a battering. A typical Empire shield is either round or triangular, and carries the emblem of the province or city of its owner."
