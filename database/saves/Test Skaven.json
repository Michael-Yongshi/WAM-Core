    "description": "Unbeknownst to man, for thousands of years he has shared his world with another and altogether different race. There have always been signs for those who cared to see them: a scurrying black shadow, an inhuman scream from the sewer, scuttling shapes at the back of the cellar. All these years these creatures have worked away in secret, burrowing beneath the world of man, undermining his great cities, infiltrating his sewers and cellars, and joining all up into a vast worldspanning labyrinth of tunnels and nests.These creatures call themselves Skaven and they are ratmen, the mutant spawn of an older age of chaos and mutation. Doubtless one day the Skaven will be ready to emerge from their tunnels and wage open war upon mankind. For centuries they have been content to feed upon his ruins, to seed plague in his cities, and spread contagion amongst his lands. At least they were content to wait and watch, for now everything has suddenly changed.Now the destruction of Mordheim has created new opportunities in the secret war against mankind. Since ancient times the Skaven have searched the world for the stones of power that men in their ignorance call wyrdstone but which Skaven have long since known as warpstone, blackstone, or seerstone.It was as a result of gnawing upon this magic stone in ages past that commonplace rats began the slow process of mutation that spawned the Skaven race. Wyrdstone is quite literally in their blood, for they feed upon it and make use of it in their foul sorceries.Until now the ratmen\u2019s search for wyrdstone has been difficult and time-consuming as the stone has grown increasingly rare, but now a new and abundant source has appeared \u2013 a dark blessing from the skies! For the Skaven of Clan Eshin, this is an especially opportune time for such a thing to happen, for, just as the Empire is divided, so the Skaven race is divided amongst itself.Clan fights clan the world over, each struggling for domination of the Council of Thirteen whose masters rule the Skaven race. Mordheim\u2019s secret is not yet revealed to all the clans, or else the City of the Damned would already be overrun with ratmen. The Nightmaster of Clan Eshin is keen to guard this secret, and for this reason has not sent his multitudinous armies into Mordheim.Instead, he has sent small warbands of Skaven skittering through secret tunnels into the city to gather up the shining stones and bring them back to the clan nests. The Skaven of Clan Eshin are supremely adapted to their task. Masters of the art of bringing silent death to their foes, they are skilled in the use of poison and trained in the thousand secrets of the assassin.Since birth Skaven warriors practise martial crafts in the ruinous temples of the Horned Rat, their everhungering and hideous god. There are none better amongst their verminous kind to gather up the treasure of Mordheim, but they must be silent, swift and efficient. Were rival Skaven clans to discover the secret of Mordheim there would come not hundreds, not thousands, but millions upon millions to contend for the wyrdstone in the City of the Damned.<i>-These are no ordinary vermin - big as a man, fast on their feet, and smart too, not like common rats. The whole city\u2019s full of \u2019em and the worse of it is they\u2019re waitin\u2019 in the old drains and sewers, watchin\u2019 for a chance to catch you on your own. Let \u2019em and you\u2019re a dead man.-</i>",

Metal shields are heavy and cumbersome, but last much longer and can take a battering. A typical Empire shield is either round or triangular, and carries the emblem of the province or city of its owner."

                            "description": "Many large and powerful creatures, as well as some of the more unhinged individuals in Mordheim, are unfortunately rather stupid. This character is subject to stupidity unless a Hero is within 6 inch of it.<br/><br/>Models that are stupid test at the start of their turn to see if they overcome their stupidity. Make a test for each model affected by stupidity. If you pass the test by rolling their Leadership value or less on 2D6 then all is well \u2013 the creatures behave reasonably intelligently and the player may move and fight with them as normal.<br/>If the test is failed all is not well. If the model is in combat it will not strike any blows during this turn of hand-to-hand combat. If he is a spell caster then he may not cast any spells this turn. If a model who fails a Stupidity test is not in hand-tohand combat, roll a D6.<br/>1-3 The warrior moves directly forward at half speed in a shambling manner. He will not charge an enemy (stop his movement 1 inch away from any enemy he would have come into contact with). He can fall down from the edge of a sheer drop (see the Falling rules) or hit an obstacle, in which case he stops. The model will not shoot this turn.<br/>4-6 The warrior stands inactive and drools a bit during this turn. He may do nothing else, as drooling is so demanding."
