    "description": "The Order of the Templars of Sigmar, universally known as the Witch Hunters, is an organisation dedicated to the eradication of heretics, be they warlocks, witches, sorcerers, fortune-tellers, necromancers, worshippers of the dark gods, deviants, mutants, blasphemers, sinners, utterers of profanities, servants of Daemons, or composers of corrupting music.Indeed, there are few who altogether escape the suspicions of the Witch Hunters with the possible exception of other Witch Hunters. It is wise to remember that the practice of magic in all its forms is deemed a most heinous crime in the Empire. Death by fire is the proscribed punishment for this particular heresy. Many of the Witch Hunters\u2019 victims treacherously avoid their fate by perishing under torture before making a full confession.In these troubled times the Witch Hunters are kept busy as more and more men turn to the dark arts. The most dangerous of all these heretics are the followers of the Chaos gods. These depraved individuals practise Daemon worship and (it is claimed) even offer human sacrifices in the name of their vile masters. Of all the enemies of Sigmar they are the most abhorrent! The destruction of Mordheim has fired the Witch Hunters with a new and irresistible sense of purpose. In the light of events the Grand Theogonist has proclaimed Sigmar\u2019s punishment on the City of the Damned. The Witch Hunters rejoice that their crusade against widespread corruption has been vindicated. Now they are ready to complete Sigmar\u2019s holy purpose by destroying his enemies within the ruins of the city itself.The Grand Theogonist has commanded the Witch Hunters to go unto that place and recover the wyrdstone for Sigmar\u2019s temple. Their crusade also pits them into the same arena as their old enemies the so-called Sisters of Sigmar \u2013 those loathsome Daemon-worshipping she-heretics whose very existence is a vile affront to the majesty of Sigmar. Witch Hunters are charismatic rabble-rousers who can soon turn a crowd to their own ends.They are universally dreaded, for everyone has something or someone to hide, and there are countless individuals who would willingly and enthusiastically hunt down and burn their own kin were a Witch Hunter to command them to do so. Bands of Witch Hunters are often accompanied by zealous citizens, Flagellants, and even holy Priests of Sigmar as well as the huge vicious warhounds which the Witch Hunters employ to track and bring down fugitives.As men accustomed to fighting Witch Hunters are well-armed and sturdy individuals. They favour hooded cloaks and headgear which conceal their appearance from the overly curious. Some wear chains about their throats to remind them of fallen comrades and old rivalries and also, so it is said, so that the iron might serve as protection against witchcraft.The followers of the Witch Hunters, the rabble that accompany  them to Mordheim, are a far more dire sight indeed \u2013 crazed and self-mutilated men who have lost or surrendered all their worldly goods and, most likely, their reason as well.<i>-Witch Hunters will burn you and your warband if you give them the slightest reason. They are well armed and equipped, and show no mercy to anyone who dares to stand in their way. They are followed everywhere in Mordheim by a rabble of fanatics and those crazed Flagellants. One word from a Witch Hunter and they\u2019ll tear you apart, burn you, decapitate you and excommunicate you from the grace of Sigmar.-</i>",
