This basic type of shield, although strong, does tend to splinter, but this can sometimes save the user\u2019s life as his enemy\u2019s weapon can get trapped allowing him to strike back whilst his enemy struggles to free his weapon. Metal shields are heavy and cumbersome, but last much longer and can take a battering. A typical Empire shield is either round or triangular, and carries the emblem of the province or city of its owner. "
