Whilst they might have been peasants and craftsmen before, and thus may not be as dangerous in a fight as seasoned mercenaries, their determination and fanaticism should not be underestimated.

Though not as deadly as a full-fledged Sword Master, their skills are still beyond the understanding of ordinary Elves. In battle a Sword Warden wields his trademark Greatsword with effortless grace, dashing aside enemy missiles as he charges into combat. They are the elite warriors of the Warband and their lighting fast strikes have left many enemies lying dead at their feet. Sword Wardens serve as the Loremaster\u2019s personal attendants and protectors."
